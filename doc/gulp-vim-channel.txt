	    Help For Gulp Vim Channel		    *gulp-vim-channel*


Gulp vim channel provides a server that runs in a background which executes
gulp tasks on demand.  The advantage over runnning gulp task on the command
line is that the gulp is already instantiated and thus starting a new tasks is
really fast.

This plugin requires a very recent vim version which supports the *+channel*
feature.

You don't need to start the server, it will start automatically, if the
current dir has a parent with a gulpfile.  There are a few commands to control
the server (start, stop, restart) and one entry point to run tasks.

						    *:Gulp*
:Gulp {task} [, {task}, ...]
    Start a new gulp {task}, you can also privde a list of tasks (separated by
    white space).

						    *:GulpStop*
:GulpStop
    Stop the server.

						    *:GulpStart*
:GulpStart
    Start the server.  It is running on `localhost:3746`, note that it is not
    secured i.e. any user on your system can send messages to it, and thus run
    a gulp tasks on your behalf.

						    *:GulpRestart*
:GulpRestart
    Stop and restart the server.  This is useful if you want to stop any tasks
    that are watching for file changes.
